## TODO

- adc_5g
  - Implement OGP and INL calibrtion
    - Starting with https://github.com/nrao/adc5g_devel
    - O and G are good.
    - P not so much

- In 8Ghzspectro.pdf, NOEMA:
  - uses a noise diode to calibrate ADC
    - Try that
  - Implements an overlapped PFB to get a flat RF band response

- [ ] Start differentiating select in 3 versions

- Black boxes
  - [ ] nrt_bw1800_ch16_fft_core (Issue with reset values for delay counters)
  - [ ] nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch16_8taps_pfb_core (Issue when generating IP)


- reorder firmware design files in project
- Adapt scripts to these new locations

TODO:
  - Add FPGA_ver verification in scripts
  - Add unbiased round in fft (and pfb?) to remove DC lines
  - TGbE_dst_addr from pulsar_mode_v0 can hold 8 destination ports, but needs to cycle through all of them.  Implement a mecanism to reset counter when last configured one is reached (when port=0 ? or 0xFF ?).
  - mydesign.SEFRAM.arm() should wait for armed PPS to start

  - Fit is now ok on that section
  - But still failing in dec_fir convert and in RAM blocks
  

## 2024/05/05
- ADC_receiver_V2
  - Fanout tree for ADC0 and ADC1 always get optimised to a single delay line with last reg feeding all recvr unints -> placement cant be successful.
  - Replace fanout tree by delay line with taps for each rcvr units.


## 2024/04/19
- ADC_receiver_V2
  - Synthesys colapses fan-out registers inserted to ease timing.  But timing fails...  Find option to preserve them.

  - Generate a bitstream anyway to test firmaware and write some python config code
  - 112 and 28 MHz streams look functionnaly good
    - But strange quantization present in Re/Im histogram -> put back some snap to pinpoint the origine of such structures
    - ![20240405_112+28MHz.png](doc/20240405_112+28MHz.png)
  - Recale units are wrong:
    - ![20240405_rescale_bug](doc/20240405_rescale_bug.png)
    - c2ReIm is wrong.  The way slicing is performed inside could explain why Re and Im behave differently.

    - MN03 08 (or 07?): SFP 1G Bidi from ROACH to Renard SEFRAM
  - Configure new interface on renard:
    - Update nenufarobs@renard:/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
    - With p2p2, addresses: 192.168.5.181/24, mtu 9000
    - sudo netplan appy

  - Add more signals
  - Burster may not be started correctly
  - Comment SEFRAM in design and ucf
  - Start fit (done in 01:05 hours)
  - burster_status_snap_ss looks ok
  - TenGbE0_stream_in_bus_ss looks ok
  - TenGbE0_spead_out_ss looks stuck
  - ('TenGbE0_tx_afull', 1) and ('TenGbE0_tx_overflow', 1)
  - Fiber was not connected -> fixed that
  - Now TenGbE0_tx_cnt increase very quickly (malformed frames?)
  - Test adc_c9r_sst_v5.py -> still ok


## 2024/02/20
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - Comment out SEFRAM_snap
  - SEFRAM starts computing as soon as mydesign.SEFRAM.arm() is called.
    - That's probably not how we what this.  
    - mydesign.SEFRAM.enable() seems to be a workaround (comment says "after dummy frame, allow outputing data and starting framer")
  - burster seems to be stuck.
    - Add snap for buster control signals
    - Add snap for TenGbE input and TenGbE spead output
  - Start fit
  - Timing violation (-0.5 ns in dec_fir0)
    - Probably ok for test.

- Valon
  - Replacing Valon with SMC100A synthesizer (5dBm power output) greatly improves the feed spectrae
    - ![20240215_BF_feed_CLKed_by_SMC100A](doc/20240215_BF_feed_CLKed_by_SMC100A.png)

    - ![20240215_HF1_feed_CLKed_by_SMC100A](doc/20240215_HF1_feed_CLKed_by_SMC100A.png)


## 2024/02/13
- Valon
  - ADC input clock is probably too low, leading to this image around Fe/4
  - Scan of Valon ouput level in (5, 2, -1, -4)
  - ![20240213_ADC_input_clk](doc/20240213_ADC_input_clk.png)
  - Image is 6dB lower at 5dBm input clock (5dBm on Valon, but signal is split and then balun on adc5g board may reduce that further...)
  - Measure the clock input swing on adc5g boards.  It should be 447 mVpp ideally.


## 2024/02/12
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - adc_receiver_v1_2024_Feb_05_1210.fpg
  - Local HI visible at all filter stages
  - ![20240212_HI_on_HBs](doc/20240212_HI_on_HBs.png)
  - But loosing 9dB after each stages.
  - No DC lines visible, except on the other polarisation, where the signal input level is very low.
  - Change Coefficient Q(20, 17) to Q(20, 19).  Why that???
  -  Start fit


## 2024/02/08-09
- ADC_calibrator.py + ADC.py
  - Add functions for ADC calibration (manual and automatic)
  

## 2024/02/07
- RFSoc
  - Integration done
- adc5g
  - Create Gui for ADC calibration
    - ![20240207_ADC_calibration_GUI](doc/20240207_ADC_calibration_GUI.png)
    - Found that ADC cores are labeled as (1, 3, 2, 4).
  

## 2024/02/04
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - adc_receiver_v1_2024_Feb_03_1855
    - Local HI visible on HBs_dec_out and HBs_HB0_out (for decimation = 2)
    - But not wfor decimation = 8 (when HBs_HB2_out and HBs_HB1_out are used...)
    - Replace HB2 and HB1 's coefficients by HB0's
    - Start fit
  - Test histogram on HBs
    - ArmedSync connected in place of PPS -> can only see one value -> Propagate PPS from top to hist entity
    - Abort fit
    - Start fit
    - Timing violation (-0.3 ns)
    - Generate bitstream anyway (see logbook on the 2024/01/30)
    - ...
- RFSoc
  - Integration almost done (chassis, power, fans, still missing some RF adaptors)


## 2024/02/04
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - Timing violation: adc_receiver_v1_2024_Feb_03_2328


## 2024/02/03
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - Fit too long.  Abort after ~20h
  - Remove hist from HBs
  - Start fit (much faster.  Bug on previous time or real issue with hist?)
  - Fit ok: adc_receiver_v1_2024_Feb_03_1855
  - Add a single hist to HBs and a 4-1 mux in front of it to select which bus to spy on.
  - Start fit


## 2024/02/02
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - Fit failed (receiver0 still present in ucf file)
  - Start fit
- Calibration ADC
  - Strange behavor on offsets
    - ADC0 ch2 and ADC1 ch3 (or 2?) don't seem to change


## 2024/02/01
- ADC_receiver_V1
  - Local HI visible on dec_out
  - Local HI visible on decim_4x_HB2_out
    - ![20240201_HI_HB2_out](doc/20240201_HI_HB2_out.png)

    - But presence of a DC line
  - Local HI visible on decim_4x_HB0_out (HB0 only) -> decimation = 2
    - ![20240201_HI_HB0_out](doc/20240201_HI_HB0_out.png)
    - No DC line
  - With ADC noise dynamic close to maximum on receiver0 inputs, the noise dynamic is 15% on the output of dec_fir, 5% at the output of H0 only and 0.6% at the output of HB2+1+0.  The H0 filter might behave badly with low-level input signal and create this DC line.
    - Replace -5 shift on dec_fir by -3 (gain of 4)
    - Put back original HB2 and HB1 filter coefficients since they are not the identified cause of DC line, so that we can look at the actual gain of the chain.  And add gain in HB filters if needed.
    - Start fit
      - Error name too long: adc_receiver_v1_receiver0_decim_4x_hist_HB0_c0_im_b0_user_data_in
      - Rename entities:
        -  adc_receiver_v1/receiver0/decim_4x/hist/HB0/c0/im/b0  ->  adc_receiver_v1/rcvr0/HBs/hist/HB0/c0/im/b0

    ```
  - Bit file generated -> to be tested
  - Remove DSP48 used as adders in snapshot blocs to save them
  - Start fit
  - L0 mixer could be optimized (16x4 DSP48 -> 16x2 DPS48) by merging 2 samples into one DSP input
    - Check that with L0_mixer_optim.slx


## 2024/01/29

  - But not for 28-MHz wide band...
    - No HI line
    - DC line -> no convergeant rounding?
    - Replace HB filters instances 2 and 1 by HB0 instances
    - Add snap between HB filters
    - Rework arb_gen and ADC_data mux to feed that to snap (and test that arb_gen is working correctly)


## 2024/01/22
- ADC_receiver_V0
  - Testing firmware
    - 2x decimation (112MHz-BW) looks good (1 dv / 2 clock_cycles)
    - 2x+4x decimation (28MHz-BW) looks good (1 dv / 8 clock_cycles)
    - For HF feed (1.6-3.2 GHz), the receiver.Fc property doesn't compute L0 tables properly.  Need to add Ny-window information.
  

## 2024/01/19

## 2023/11/09
- ADC_receiver_V0
  - with of the filtrer is too narrow by a factor of 2
    - ![Alt text](doc/20231110_narrow_filter.png)
    - Wrong use of scipy.signal.firwin (mixup between f_s and f_ny)
    - Fixed it
    - Realise that we can loosen the filter length (256 -> 128) to get the right rejection
    - Set new coef to slx file
  - Start fit
  - Filter looks good now
    - Can see HI, and radars
    - ![Alt text](doc/20231110_235M_filter.png)


## 2023/11/06
- ADC_receiver_V0
  - Output of dec_fir look good now regarding NCO
    - Can see HI, and radars
  - However, the with of the filtrer is too narrow by a factor of 2 -> need to understand and fix that.
  - Change back dataformat to original configuration now that it is understood.
  - Use Q16.15 coefficients for receiver0
  - Start fit
  - Data still look good, but wrong dec_out snap data width.  Fix, increase depth and fit again

  - Start fit


## 2023/10/06
- dec_fir_sim
  - Simulation looks good...
- ADC_receiver_V0
  - dec_fir snapshot read back as 32-bit data.  But it's 64bits...
  - Data saturation located on dec_fir output could be due to cast from Fix_40_30 to Fix_16_15 in dec_fir, after >>5.
    - Cast to Fix_32_23 and record data to check.
    - Start fit

  - read_pulsar_pcap.py
    - Start looking into data recorded in a pcap file
    - This 7th 10G interface looks similar to the same subband of SEFRAM
      - ![](./doc/20230103_7th_10G_spec.png)
    - And we can see the bandpass for the PFB chans

## 2023/02/01-02

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Only -1, 0 on first 10G (out of band -> understandable)
  - On 7th 10G (ch=768..895, F=[1387.5..1616.94] MHz), with Channelizer.scale = 1, on feed=BF, samples follow gaussian distribution within [-80..80].
  - Issue with SPEAD format.
    - One 64-bit word shift
    - z^-1 is missing on data bus withrespect to dv/eof in pulsar_mode_v0/channelizer/frm*
    - Fixed
  - Start fit
  - Timing violations
  - Generate bitstream anyway for tests.


## 2023/01/31

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Start fit
  - Same timing failure (-0.028ns slack) as before
  - Use XPS to generate bitstream anyway, save project
  - But checking "EDK/ISE/Bitgen" restarts all the way from synthesis
    - Can we only start bitgen?
    - i.e.: cd implementation ; bitgen -w -f bitgen.ut system ; cd ..
  - Anyway, after 2h, the bitstream is ready.
  - 10G links are not stuck anymore.
    - SEFRAM looks OK
    - First 10G interface prints (avr ~= 893.54MiB):

## 2023/01/30

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - 7 violations in fft0/fft_wideband_real  (> -0.104ns)
  - Generate bitstream anyway for test
    - Same as 2023/01/27, but generate bitstream from XPS gui.  And again, restarts map and PAR from start...
  - Need to improve fft area_group to make easier fits
  - sync_in is not latched in reorder, but only registered -> gets stuck at startup
    - Fix
  - Start fit
    - Forgot to check all boxes first: this time only creating bit map...
  - Start fit
    - Twice.  Error with some files in /tmp/xil*.  -> remove them all.

## 2023/01/27

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Fit failed.
  - Planhead to make this snap diagnostic working
    - Nothing really helpfull to fix the fit.
  - Generate bitstream anyway.  Will run with lower ADC speed.
    - disable the PAR timing check
      - xps
      - open project 'pulsar_mode_v0/XPS_ROACH2_base/system.xmp'
      - Project > Project Options > Design Flow > and unselected the “Treat timing closure failure as an error” and finally save the project.
      - Select only EDK/ISE/Bitgen in CASPER_XPS
      - Run XPS
      - But recompile all design... (without XSG et IP generation)
  - Can see with snap that reorder is feeding data to SPEAD and then to 10G IPs when PPS has not occured.
    - Reorder submodules were not designed to wait for sync to start working, but are only reset by sync -> Add arm input that prevent reorder modules to transpose when sync has not occured.



## 2023/01/25-26

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - After struggling some time with the design it seems that no PPS is seen by the ROACH2

- Config serveur
  - NRT off. Retreive serveur to push script on git for Louis
  - Network conf is located in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Same timing violations.
    - `-equivalent_register_removal off;` makes no difference
  - Trying `NET "net_name" KEEP=TRUE;` on:
    - sys_block_inst/sys_block_inst/fab_clk_counter
    - all other free running regs used in ffts and pfb that drive delays

  - Fit failed (Slack > -1.2ns)
    - But -2.8 ns slacks related to `sys_block_inst/sys_block_inst/fab_clk_counter` are now gone.
    - Still some violations to address but look more classical.


## 2023/01/05

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Timing violation < -2.8 ns
    - Lots involving sys_block_inst/sys_block_inst/fab_clk_counter_31
      - This counter is a free running counter
      - It is very similar to the ones used to implement digital delay lines in the design.
      For example: pulsar_mode_v0_x0/sefram/fft0/fft_wideband_real/fft_biplex_real_4x/bi_real_unscr_4x/delay1/counter
      - Try "equivalent_register_removal off" during map to prevent these registers to be merged.
      - Search for a way to do it in the ucf file instead in ![cgd.pdf](doc/cgd.pdf), ![web](https://www.xilinx.com/htmldocs/xilinx14_7/cgd.pdf)
        - `NET  "net_name"      KEEP=TRUE;`
        - `INST "instance_name" KEEP_HIERARCHY=TRUE;`
    - Some involving ADC[01] interface
      - will look later at that.
  - Start map with
  `map -timing -detail -ol high -xe n -mt 2 -global_opt speed -equivalent_register_removal off -o system_map.ncd -w -pr b system.ngd`
    - OK
  - Start par with

    - OK
  - Start post_par_trce with

    - Could be done by writing even and odd samples in 2 different memories (half the size), that would be read back in // to output [n, n+1] samples at the same time.
      - Start working on reorder_v1_sim to implement this.


## 2022/11/15

- Test pulsar_test_10g_v1
  - Make port ranges the same for all 10G interfaces
    - Only one TGbEs_dst_port_cfg/TGbEs_dst_port_wr for all 10Gs.
  - Fit and test.
  - Sometimes, all 10G overflow when design starts
    - On all streams (at once?)
    - Could be the freerunning period counter not being reset -> add reset
  - Fit
  - Timing issue in comparator+OR logic, fixed
  - Fit
  - Bug in enable/rst
  - Fit and test ok (5-10 starts without issue)
  - This validates the 10G streams test setup and the logic locks for 8 10G interfaces.
  - Moving on to the transposition now.
  - Clone as pulsar_mode_v0 


- Pulsar mode packet format:
  - channel organisation in 10G streams
  - 1024 channels, 8 lanes/10G_if
  - 128 channels per lane
  - 1 sample is complex, polarized, 8-bit signed data -> 32 bits/4 bytes
  - One jumbo frame can fit 8192 bytes --> 2048 samples
  - One 10G_if could send its payload to P different UPD ports feeding P recording processes:
      -   1 packet  / if of (128 channels x   16 samples) / packets.
      -   2 packets / if of ( 64 channels x   32 samples) / packets.
      -   4 packets / if of ( 32 channels x   64 samples) / packets.
      -   8 packets / if of ( 16 channels x  128 samples) / packets.
      - 128 packets / if of (  1 channel  x 2048 samples) / packets.
      -   P packets / if of (  C channels x    D samples) / packets.
          -   C = 128/P
          -   D = 2048/C = 16.P
  - Each 10G_if would need to double-buffer S = P.C.D samples
    - S = P.C.D = P (128/P) (16 P) = 2048 P
    - 32 bits/samples and 2 buffers of OnChip RAM to double-buffer these packets
    - Buffer_size_per_10G = P x 2048 x 32 bits x 2 buffers = 131072.P bits
  - For all 8 10G_ifs, that adds up to 8 x Buffer_size_per_10G = 1048576.P bits
  - The XC6VSX475T FPGA embbeds 1064 RAMB36 of 36 kb that can be configured as 1K x 36 bits.
  - So we roughtly need P * 1048576/36kb = 29 x P RAMB36, but our datapath is 32 or 64 bits
  - So more precicely, we need P x 2048 / (1Kword RAMB36) x 32 bits / (32-bit word RAMB36) x 2 buffers x 8 10G_ifs = 32 x P = (3P)% of available RAMB36
  - So, we have plenty of RAMB36 to accomodate P = {2, 4, 8, ...}, but not for P=128 (384% of RAMB36)

- pulsar_mode_v0
  - Integrate and modify
  - Start fit, but still running after > 10h -> kill PAR


## 2022/11/14

  - but missing second IP:port at start (extra eop due to armed_pps)
    - Separate force_eof from armed_pps
    - Fixed in pulsar_test_10g_v1_2022_Nov_14_1610
  - Only make port configuration in a round-robin distribution, no reason to do it on IPs too.
  - Replicate this scheme on all 10Gs

- pulsar_mode
  - Meeting regarding subband distribution on 10G links
    - 1024 sb, 8 if
    - 128 sb/if
    - 1, 2 or 4 recording processes  -> 1, 2, 4 different destination IP:port
    - What does this imply in term of FIFO depth, transposition and framinf on the FPGA side
    - GPU-Direct could handle 1 process directly, but we are not sure to implement it quickly.

    - Missing some z^-1 on 10G?  Add some after rst_core and sync
  - Start fit.


- extragalactic mode:
  - PFB ch16, 8-tap seems to be generatable after all...
  - fft_wideband_real 2^5 pts, 2^4 sim inputs seems to be generated if "unscamble output" is deactivated.
    - But "manually" unscrambling 16 channels (on 8 lanes) is possible.
    - However, fft_biplex_real_4x is broken
  - Trying fft_biplex_real_2x
    - doc: "A real-sampled biplex FFT, with output demuxed by 2."   32 samples in, 16 chans out ?
    - Looks OK
    - Simulation nrt_bw1800_ch16_fft_biplex_core_sim.slx
    - But no...  That's 16 real streams in, not 16 samples in //.
    - Asking CASPER on Slack, # mlib_devel channel.
      - ![](./doc/20221018_slack.png)
    - Generate fft (complex FFT suggested by Jack) side to side to fft_wideband_real for comparison.
    - The complex FFT's fft_biplex breaks the same way the fft_wideband_real's fft_biplex_real_4x does.  It might be easier to look into the complex FFT first for debugging.
    - Put side by side complex FFT 32 pts and complex FFT 64 pts
    -

  - Start fit.

- Pulsar mode:
  - channel organisation in 10G streams
  - 1024 channels, 8 lanes/10G_if
  - 128 channels per lane
  - 1 sample is complex, polarized, 8-bit signed data -> 32 bits/4 bytes
  - One jumbo frame can fit 8192 bytes --> 2048 samples
  - If 128 channels are packed together, that's 16 samples max per channels
  - Is it better to send 2048 samples for one chan before going to the next one?
    - Impossible since required buffers reach up to 2048x1024x4 bytes = 8MB (twice that for double buffer)
    - But could be 8 packets of (16 channels x 128 samples) per packets.

- Discussions SEFRAM et ressources.  À discuter:
  > Pour le mode galactique (PFB-FFT128) et extragalactique (PFB-FFT32), je vais continuer d'essayer d'optimiser les Win-FFT4096 du SEFRAM pour respecter les timing et donc fournir les 2 SEFRAM+Channelizer demandés.    Mais   > ça reste incertain...
  > 
  > Mais pour le mode pulsar (PFB-FFT2048), ça va être encore plus dur de faire rentrer tout le monde (PFB-FFT2048 + Win-FFT4096 + cornerturn_8x8 + 8 tramers 10G)...
  > 
  > Est-ce qu'il serait jouable de dégrader (aussi... :( ) le SEFRAM pour passer à 1024 canaux de 1.76MHz (au lieu de 2048 canaux de 0.9MHz)?  Donc une FFT2048 au lieu d'une FFT4096.
  > 
  > Pour le mode pulsar, il n'y aurait qu'un unique PFB-FFT2048 (au lieu d'un PFB-FFT2048 + Win-FFT4096).  Sa sortie serait dupliquée vers:

  > Et pour rester cohérent avec les autres modes, on passerait les modes galactique (PFB-FFT128) et extragalactique (PFB-FFT32) avec un SEFRAM Win-FFT204: FFT moins lourde, peut-être plus facile à tasser avec le reste.  ET dans un second temps, peut être qu'on pourra remettre le  même PFB que pulsar à la place de l'apodisation (Win) pour être encore plus homogène).

- Install LF feed equivalent noise setup in computer room:
  - NoiseCom 2-4 GHz with 7 dB attenuation (instead of 15 dB to compensate for losses in splitter)
  - TTI TGR6000 with 1420 MHz, 50 mV sine
  - Band pass filter : micro-tronics BPC12740
  - Diagram below
  - LF feed system noise is ~20dB over ADC noise floor -> OK
  - From the ADC input dynamic range, we would like a little bit more of power, even if that would bring more range issue with RFI (Would it???).  **No large amplification is required**.
  - After a circulator, the level would be only 10dB over ADC noise floor.  Good for test, but probably short for actual observations.
  - A low pass with 1.8GHz cut-off frequency may not be absolutely usefull
    - This has to be tested with the actual feed since it seems to have sharper edges.
    - To increase the guard band, could we slightly increase the Fs?  2x 1.85 GHz?  2x 1.9 GHz?
  
      ```graphviz
      digraph hierarchy {
        nodesep=1.0 // Increases the separation between nodes
      
        node [color=Red,fontname=Courier,shape=box] // All nodes will this shape and colour
        edge [color=Blue, style=dashed] // All the lines look like this
      
        subgraph cluster_roach{
          label ="ROACH2";
          adc0 [label=ADC0];
          adc1 [label=ADC1];
          {rank=same;adc0 adc1} // Put them on the same level
          fpga [label=FPGA];
      
        }
        
        noise [label="Noise Diode"];
        noise -> splitter
        sine -> splitter
        splitter -> "Band Pass"
        "Band Pass" -> adc0
        Open -> adc1
        adc0 -> fpga
        adc1 -> fpga
      
      }
      ```

      ![equivalent_noise_from_LF_feed](./doc/equivalent_noise_from_LF_feed.png)


- Extrapolation for HF feed
  - We do not have, yet, filters to mimic or to condition the band for sampling.
  - Since the band is wider, we can expect a larger V_RMS noise and the noise density on this feed looks a bit higher, leading to better feed noise to ADC noise ratio.
  - This has to be confirmed anyways, but **no large amplification is required**.

### Measurements of RF bands of LF and HF NRT feeds

#### Feed BF
##### Direct
![pol E, BF](./doc/mesure_cornet/ebf.png)
![pol W, BF](./doc/mesure_cornet/wbf.png)

##### Circulateur
![pol E, BF, after circulateur](./doc/mesure_cornet/ebf-circu.png)
![pol W, BF, after circulateur](./doc/mesure_cornet/wbf-circu.png)

#### Feed HF
##### Direct
![pol E, HF](./doc/mesure_cornet/ehf.png)
![pol W, HF](./doc/mesure_cornet/whf.png)


### Setup to mimic Feed Frequency responses
#### BF before circulator

- NoiseCom 2-4 GHz generator with 15-16 dB attenuation provides the right noise power density (-56dBm/-58dBm) in the HF band, but the band is too wide (1-5GHz at -10dBc)
  - Need for additionnal:
    - Sharp low pass at 1.8-1.9 GHz
    - Sharp high pass at 1.2 GHz

- The NoiseCom 6110, 1500 MHz, provides a similar PSD with 33dB attenuation.
  - Need for additionnal:
    -  Sharp high pass at 1.2 GHz


#### BF after circulator

The circulator provides an extra 10 dB power drop in the band of the LF feed.


#### HF

- NoiseCom 2-4 GHz generator with 12-13 dB attenuation provides the right noise power density (-52dBm/-53dBm) in the HF band, but the band is too wide (1-5GHz at -10dBc)
  - Need for additionnal:
    - Low pass at 3.6 GHz
    - High pass at 1.4 GHz


#### Available filters

- micro-tronics BPC12740
  - 1.23-1.8GHz -> pertes d'insertion: -2 dB
  - 0-1.16 + 1.848-6.69 ->  réjection > 50dB
  - remontée entre 6.7 et 8GHz (< -20dB)
  - Perfect to mimic LF Feed with NoiseCom 2-4GHz with -15dB

- K&L 5B121-2100/T1250-0/0
  - Probably 2100 ± 1250/2 MHz
  - 1.6-2.6 GHz (bande passante à -3 dB)

- K&L 6B120-1666/150-0/0
  - 1.6-1.7 GHz à -3 dB

- K&L 5B120-1350/U210-0/0
  - 1.22-1.47 GHz -3 dB

- K&L 6B120-3375/350-0/0
  - 3.2-3.5 GHz à -3dB


#### Setup

##### LF feed

- NoiseCom 2-4 GHz with 15 dB attenuation
- micro-tronics BPC12740

- FSH8
  - Spectrum:
    - -58 dBm with 3-MHz RBW within 1.2-1.8GHz
      - Conversion with https://www.harald-rosenfeldt.de/2018/08/19/measuring-rf-noise-with-an-rf-spectrum-analyzer-or-how-to-convert-dbm-into-v-sqrthz/
        - noise density: n[V/sqrt(Hz)] = sqrt(R * 0.001 * 10 ** (PdBm/10) / RBW_Hz) = sqrt(50*0.001*10**(-58/10)/3e6)
        - PkPk = 6.6 * n * sqrt(BW_Hz) = sqrt(50*0.001*10**(-58/10)/3e6)*6.6*sqrt(600e6) = 26 mV
      - 
  - Power meter:
    - Fc=1.5GHz, Ch BW=0.9MHz, P = 8.7dB
    - Fc=1.5GHz, Ch BW=0.6MHz, P = 7.7dB
    - Fc=1.5GHz, Ch BW=0.3MHz, P = 4.7dB
    - Measurements probably incorrect -> redo after zeroing the device

- LeCroy WaveRunner 640Zi
  - Vrms: 1 mV
  - Pkpk: 10 mV -> agree with PkPk from Spectrum?

- Testing other windows and tap length to reach narrower transition band with same rejection.
  - Hamming with 16 taps looks good.
  - Testing synthesis with such params
  - PFB IP generation takes forever.  Frozen?
  - Restart IP generation with 12 taps only.
    - Stuck again.  Lots of dead processes from XST and simulink -> clean all
  - Restart IP generation with 12 taps only.
    - OK
  - Restart IP generation with 16 taps.
    - OK

## 2022/03/24

- Looking at raw data received on copper5.  Could they be read in a wrong way?
- The odd and even samples are swapped in the packets, leading to ghost line and strange pfb gain response
  - On 64-bit words, 2 samples (8bits, Re/Im, polX/Y = 32 bits) are packed.
  - I choose to put the first sample on the LSB part of the bus -> wrong choice
- Fixed in adc_c9r_v3/select_4f64
  - D-latched word is assigned to MSB now.
  - Recompile
- Checking PFB theoretical rejection
  - ![pic1](./doc/pfb_response_64chans_8taps_hamming.png)

  - ![pic1](./doc/chan2_10-140MHz.png)
  - ![pic1](./doc/chan51_1200-1600MHz.png)
  - Looks OK.   Still some harmoncs -> need ADC calibration (not yet performed here)
- Deploy new firmware adc_c9r_v3_2022_Mar_24_1150 with sample swap removed.  Remove patches from recording and plotting scripts.
- Looks OK at first glance, now.


## 2022/03/22

- Tests of sine across the band.
  - Strange freq response within a channel:
    - presence of a second line
    - and amplitude is changing a lot across the channel
- Back to simulation of pfb_fir + fft_wideband_real
  - pfb_fir is rotten (**EDIT (2022/03/25): Dirac generated in simulation turned out to be at the wrong time with respect to SYNC**)
    - Impulse response looks bad ![pic1](./doc/rotten_pfb_impulse_response.png)
  - Regenerating pfb and test benches
    - Expected:
      - ![pic1](./doc/PFB_coefs.png)
      - ![pic1](./doc/PFB_FIR_response.png)
    - pfb_fir_64ch_sim.slx
      - Looks good with default latency params (but 128 chans and 8 taps)
    - channelizer_64ch_sim.slx
      - Looks good with default latency params (but 128 chans and 8 taps)
      - Looks good with original pfb generated for adc_c9r_v3.slx
    - Observed:
      - ![pic1](./doc/pfb_fir_64ch_8tpas_sim.png)
- Regenerate nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core with no optimisation
- Recompile adc_c9r_v3.slx
- Check what happens with generator on ADC0 only
  - Everything looks good (except image lines and bandpass response) when swapping channels and forcing one of them at 0.



## 2022/03/21

- TGR6000 can be controlled from cedric-HP-ZBook-15-G2 server now.
- The PFB channel outputs look great now.  It this beacause of the faulty USB connections?
  - ![pic1](./doc/Chan1_10mV.png)
  - ![pic2](./doc/Chan1_120mV.png)
- Calibration methods nrao_adc5g_cal and nrao_adc5g_cal give similar results for Offset and Gain, but delays seems opposite...
  - Will try to cal O et G first and then Delays.
  - Delays are opposite dur to fit model -> fixed.  But delay calibrations are quite inconsistent (large variance estimation and when used, do not look great)
  

## 2022/03/19

- Setting up TGR6000 frequency generato to work with VISA
  - Requires python 3.6+
    ```python
    pip install pyvisa
    import pyvisa as visa
    visa.__version__  ->  '1.11.3'
    rm = visa.ResourceManager()
    inst = rm.open_resource("TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::9221::SOCKET", read_termination='\n', write_termination='\n')
    inst.query("*IDN?")
    inst.write('freq 21.12345')
    inst.write('MVLEV 10')
    ```
  - ERROR in doc: freq is MHZ, not HZ


## 2022/03/17

- USB ports on cedric-HP-ZBook-15-G2 server used to control the ROACH2 were forcing a reset on the PPC uboot.
- Rebbot of server was enough to fix 
  > Hi CASPER members,

- Found thanks to a spare ROACH2 lent by Guy
- Back in computer room
- DHCP server not starting on cedric-HP-ZBook-15-G2 server
  - sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
- Full test


## 2022/03/15

- Add udev rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules to always provide access to Valon here: /dev/ttyUSB_valon
- ROACH2 seems bricked...
  - Can't boot, ping, or minicom the PPC uBoot

## 2022/03/11

- PFB+FFT simulation
  - Same image but at a different frequency (34.275 rather than ~35.5)
  - But found wrong config for PFB (2^12 chan instead of 2^7)
  - Resimulation
- Fighting with TTI TGR6000 VXI...
  - Trying python-vxi, pyvisa, ...


## 2022/03/10

- Changing AgilentE8257D for a TTI (generator required for NRT)


## 2022/03/09

- Simulating PFB+FFT on a 21.9726 sine


## 2022/03/08

- Add RJ45 to AgilentE8257D for remote control
  - http://192.168.40.100
  - install https://pypi.org/project/RxLab-Instruments/
- Create nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_biplex_pfb_core.slx
- Generate NGC over nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core !!!
- Generate NGC in the right place (..._biplex_...)
- Generate NGC for nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core (destroyed by mistake...)
- resynth_netlist('nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core','-lc', 'off')
- resynth_netlist('nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_biplex_pfb_core','-lc', 'off')
- Create adc_c9r_v3 and integrate new pfb (nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_biplex_pfb_core)
  - casper_xps
  - Wrong signal size between pfb and fft (36 to 18 bits)
  - Revert to old nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core
  - Simulation needed to understand this.
  - Synth adc_c9r_v3:
    - adc_c9r_v2 design with new nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core (port0/1 reassigned) 


## 2022/03/07

- OGP calibration with https://github.com/nrao/adc5g_devel not fantastic
- Try fitting `x[0] + x[1]*np.sin(wt[:,core_idx] + x[2])` instead of `p[0] +  p[1] * sin + p[2] * cos`


## 2022/02/22

- Streamer still pushing data to copper5: nice!
- Back on calibration...


## 2022/01/25

- adc_c9r_v2
  - Not better...
    - fft1 sync input not connected!  Forced to 0 but used to reset some counters in fft stages: not good...
    - Connect sync to fft1
  - Both chans behave identically now
  - But strong lines
  - Reinsert PFB
  - fit...
  - adc_c9r_v2_2022_Jan_25_1452.fpg
    - YES!
    - Two lines (18MHz and 32MHz(?)), quite good rejection elsewhere (but needs to be evaluated more precisely) 


## 2022/01/24

- adc_c9r_v2
  - Polarisation swap looks good after fft and rescaler looks ok on polarisations
  - Issue seems to be located on the IOs of the PFB FIR
    - Suppress PFB and connect directly ADCs to FFT inputs
  - Fit...


## 2022/01/23

- adc_c9r_v2
  - Pol1 is not real in chan0...
    - Injecting 0's didn't help...
    - Add possibility to feed ADC0 or ADC1 (or 0 or periodic signal) into both digital chains
    - fit...


## 2022/01/20

- Change Fin freq to 18.30 MHz
  - Should apprear at +4.2375 MHz in channel 1
- adc_c9r_v2
  - select_4f64 config: swapped nof_chan and samples_per_frames on bus -> Fixed
  - Pol1 is not real in chan0...
    - Inject 0 on output of fft to pinpoint issue...


## 2022/01/19

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Remove debug HW from design (constant injection to understant previous problems)
  - Add overflow fft flags
  - Export nof_chan+nof_samples_per_frames from select to SPEAD packetizer
  - Setup SPEAD header ItemPointers to fit nof_chan and samples_per_frames
  - When FFT or FFT1 overflow is ≠ 0, latch it.
  - Fit to get the last stable version
    - adc_c9r_v0_2022_Jan_19_1145.fpg
    - Moving to v2 (v1 had counters instead of PFB+FFT)
- select_8chan_sim
  - transfert fix from adc_c9r_v0/select into this test bench and modify input stream to get same behavior.
- select
  - select -> select_8f64:
    - select 8 chans from 64x28MHz (current as reference)
  - Trim select_8f64 to get select_4f64
    - select 4 chans from 64x28MHz (for galactic observations)
    - Add output port to forward config to SPEAD header
- adc_c9r_v2
  - Integrate select_4f64
  - fit
  - Looks good!

## 2022/01/18

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Still struggling with time closure in fft and pfb.
  - -0.617ns slack on adc5g clk
  - Will try to confine the design in the 50% in the middle of the design
    - only using:
      - 15% register
      - 22% LUTs
      - 13% RAMB36
      - 15% RAMB18
      - 43% DSP48
    - PlanAhead
      - CLOCKREGION range X0Y0:X1Y8
      - SLICE range X0Y0:X209Y359
      - restrict:
        - PFB to CLOCKREGION range X0Y5:X1Y6
        - FFT to CLOCKREGION range X0Y2:X1Y5
  - We have a fit!
  - Channels 9 and 10 contain a strong line.
    - FFT of adc snap says 42 MHz
      - Chan0 is -14.0625 to 14.0625 MHz
      - Chan1 is 14.0625-42.1875 MHz
      - Chan2 is 42.1875-70.3125 MHz
      - Chan3 is 70.3125-98.4375 MHz
    - So, the line is just between chan1 and chan2
    - So, the fft outputs are early by one sample, or sync is late by one
      - Fixed in select/channel[0..7] after 8to1-mux on datain
  - Fit again.
  - adc_c9r_v0_2022_Jan_18_2022.fpg is looking good!
    
  
## 2022/01/16

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Still struggling with time closure in fft and pfb.
  - Add z^-1 every where, but doesn't help...
  - mailing list says some thing about resynthesizing the netlists with "-lc off"
    - https://www.mail-archive.com/casper@lists.berkeley.edu/msg05588.html
    - resynth_netlist('nrt_bw1800_ch64_fft_core','-lc', 'off')
    - resynth_netlist('nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch64_8taps_pfb_core','-lc', 'off')
  - fit...


## 2022/01/15

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Still struggling with time closure in fft and pfb.
    - Affected by routing between DSP and/or DRAM (80%)
    - use adders from DSP48 adders in fft
    - Increase z^-1 on DSP and BRAM but the router should know better and don't spread ressources on all corners of the chip... :(
   


## 2022/01/09

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Difficult to get a fit for this test (3 attemps)
  - Found a bug on the input of rescale
    - Led to Re and Im to be replicated
    - Doesn't explain why one chan is not shown.
  - After fix, can't fit design anymore (slack = -1.7ns)
    - Issue in fft[01]/.../conv
      - Reduce z^-2 to z^-1 (simple adder don't need 2 clk cycles...)
  - Regenerate fft ngc
  - Fit

## 2022/01/08

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Only getting samples from pol0.
  - Add a bunch of snapshot IPs to pinpoint the problem.
  - Timing issue
  - found a label bug anyway
  - refit
  - Found how to increase par effort in mlib_dev/xps_base/XPS_ROACH2_base/etc/fast_runtime.opt


## 2022/01/07

- adc_c9r_v0
  - Test firmware
  - Write stream analysis to validate data (overflow, underflow, spectrum, ...)
  - Getting pairs of bytes strictly equals
    - Looking like Re=Im for all samples...
  - Add Muxes on ADC output and FFT output to locate issue
  - fit
  - Setting one of the ADC inputs to 0 doesn't change the channel!
    - Keep checking...

## 2022/01/06

- adc_c9r_v0
  - nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch2048_8taps_pfb_core
    - Timing violation
    - Set z^-2 on multipliers to ease timing between bram used as delays and mults
    - Fit is OK
  - Add "Swap 32-bit words on the 64-bit bus" on the output databus of select because counters go as 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6
- Discussions with Ismaël Cognard
  - 64x28MHz channels are good for Galactic observations -> keep developping that design
    - 4 channels at most seem sufficient
    - Would be nice to distribute channels as UDP packets addressed to different ports
  - But for extra galactic observations, we need wider channels (32x56 or 16x112 MHz)
    - Will make a design for 16x112MHz chans.  With 2 10G interfaces, 1 chan each.



## 2022/01/05

- Bug in valid from select (1 clk too long)
- Ready not generated correctly (only once instead of for each packet)
- Fix, sim and fit
- Frames look ok now.
  - Endians are probably not the best choice.
  - Some fields are useless in header
  - See with Ismaël about that.
- adc_c9r_v0
  - Reinsert select module
  - Generate pcore for 8-tap PFB (nrt_bw1800_2pols_ch2048_8taps_pfb_core)
  - Generate pcore for FFT (nrt_bw1800_ch64_fft_core)
    - Error:
      - coeff_gen simulink Initialization commands cannot be evaluated.
      - Caused by: Library must be saved before creating new library links
    - Start over with nrt_bw1800_ch2048_fft_core and modify nfft
  - Integrate pcore to adc_c9r_v0


## 2022/01/04

- Framer gets stuck.
  - select_chan0_status = 4
  - TenGbE1_tx_afull = 1
  - TenGbE1_tx_overflow = 1
  - Not much information -> need to go back to easier things
- Upgrade roach2_tut_tge.[slx|py]
  - Sends packets with different sizes and periods
  - MTU was 1500 on copper, so frames > ~1500 were dropped by NIC
- Sets copper5 MTU to 9000
  - sudo ip link set mtu 9000 10GB02
- Framer sends one 8256B frame and gets stuck.
  - Confirmed in simulation: the configuration of the SPEAD framer makes eof pulses at the wrong spot


## 2022/01/03

- Connect a HP E4420B as a source signal instead of a Valon clock 2.
  - Better, less harmonics
    - Provide some plots
  - Still a "strong" line at Fs/4 (same level as DC and NY)
  - Strange saw tooth pattern on a 10MHz sine
    - Interleaved ADC calibration?
      - Yes.  After MMCM calibration, it's required to perform OGP and INL calibration
      - See https://github.com/nrao/adc5g_devel
- Connect 10G from slot 0 port 0 to Copper5 to test select, SPEAD framer and 10G configuration


## 2022/01/02

- Mixup between number of samples and number of words (2 samples / words)
- It take almost half the time required to buffer data to export them.
  - So plenty of time...
  - Checking frames now, and generating data_valid and ready 
- Fit a design with ADC, select, SPEAD framer and 10G


## 2022/01/01

- Seems to wokr with 7 channels.
  - The 8th one doen't seem to have enough time to get exported -> to be checked.


## 2021/12/29

- Single channel buffer seems to work.
  - Buffers samples packed by 2 (2 x 2 samples x 2 pols x 2 ReIm) for the selected channel
  - Reads-out with simple re signal
  - Can't parametrise because Xilinx FIFO depth are configured from drop-box menu
- Start implementing 8 chans in project select_8chan_sim


## 2021/12/19

- Thoughts about payload filling
  - 10G units will use SPEAD packet format and 1024 64-bit words of payload.  Fitting a jumboframe < 9000 bytes
  - We output int8 complex polarized data samples, leading to 32-bits data sample, 2 data samples per words.
  - When outputing 5, 6, 7, 8 channels:  256 samples per packet
  - When outputing       3, 4 channels:  512 samples per packet
  - When outputing          2 channels: 1024 samples per packet
  - When outputing          1 channel : 2048 samples per packet
  - WHen receiving 8 blocks, we got 8x8 = 64 channels


## 2021/12/17

- Framer looks good!
- Keep adc_sst_v4 as reference.
- Start adc_c9r_v0 design
  - adc_channelizer_v0
  - ADC, PFB (2taps, 128chan), FFT 128 chan
  - 64 chans of 28.125MHz
  - Select 8 chans out of 64 to feed a 10G link


## 2021/12/16

- Extract pulse_extender from power_vacc and crosspower_vacc to reuse it between all blocks
- Bug fixed on the 2021/12/11 restored somehow...
  - Fix again and resynth
- But that was not the right bug...
  - Dataframe is now of the right size
  - But channels are off by 8 channels (1 FFT frame sample) 
  - Fix, and synth


## 2021/12/15

- For several days, timing closure issues on the design...
- In power_vacc and crosspower_vacc, could merge all pulse extenders into a single one distributed to all vacc.


## 2021/12/11
 
- Frames look good.  But late by 8 channels
- Confirmed in sim, fixed, resynth


## 2021/12/11

- Found bug in dump address condition
- Fix in sim, running synth
- Looks ok -> integrate it into adc_sst_v4 and synth


## 2021/12/10

- vacc_packetizer_sim
  - HW looks ok.
  - recording is fine, but counters are stuck to 0xfe


## 2021/12/08

- vacc_packetizer_sim
  - Add "chunk" support to export the vacc data as 16 4kb frames
  - Make a test design with counters as data to check framer and one_GbE
  - Sim is ok, running synth


## 2021/12/01-07

- adc_sst_v3:
  - Timing issues with vacc, power and cross power
    - Play with PlanHead with not much success
    - Insert reg before adder in vacc-> improvement
    - Add pipeline (1->2) to power/crosspower mults
    - Still some issue with pfb_2taps/pfb_fir/pol1_in1/rom1
  - Timing are ok now.  Can test 1GbE.
- one_gbe_ref_design
  - Connect a frame generator to a 1GbE IP to check unit.
  - After several adjustments in the frame generator, can receive data on nanunib (wireshark)
    - (IFG, frm_len) = (220000000, 128)  -> OK
    - but breaks for frm_len > 8192
    - Need to modify framer to split the (32 + 256*8*4*8) bytes frame into 16 frames


## 2021/11/25

- Moved the ROACH2 and all subsystems to CDV's office for HW tests
- Realized that LVDS bus sampling clock is referenced to ZDOK_ADC0 input and that that ADC clock for ADC1 has to be skewed from ADC0
- In fact, both ADC LVDS buses need to be adjusted with respect to the FPGA serdes clock
- Found some code here: https://github.com/Smithsonian/adc_tests
- Forked here for backup: https://github.com/CedricDViou/adc_tests
- mdl file couldn't be compiles (.so missing error...)
- But code adjust the mmcm PLL phase
- Run it in a loop for the 56 possibilities and write down the edges of the eye
- Both spectrae are now the same and the noise floor is FPGA limited (fixed point FFT)

## 2021/11/23

- adc_sst_v3_2021_Nov_23_0941.fpg
  - Fixed new_acc generation
    - Get im=0 at DC
  - Vacc dumped from BRAM is good now (no chan offset anymore)
  - Vacc dumped from snapshot is delayed by 8 samples (1 clk cycle) -> fixed
  - recompile
- adc_sst_v3_2021_Nov_23_1226.fpg
  - Vacc dumped from snapshot is good now (no chan offset anymore)
  - move on to next functionalities
  - Check this noise level


## 2021/11/22

- adc_sst_v3
  - Accumulated frames not showing im=0 for DC -> wrong framer
  - Replace blackbox by their simulink models (long...)
  - try to simulate

## 2021/11/20

- adc_sst_v3
  - Add BRAM vacc buffers
  - FFT shift was not strong enough
    - Better with 0xaaf regarding lines, but could be too strong for noise -> to be adjusted
  - ADC noise on chan0 is too strong wrt ADC1
    - Check HW
  - Disentangle vacc_snapshots and vacc_BRAM correctly
    - but residual latency needs to be fixed
      - 2x8 for BRAM
      - 3x8 for snapshot
    - Add
      - z^-2 on output of FFT (cmmon to BRAM and snapshot)
      - z^-1 on snapshot datapath
  - recompile

## 2021/11/18-19

- adc_sst_v3
  - Trying to disentangle FFT output channels
    - Wrong reordering in Vacc (already done in FFT -> output in natural order)
    - Wrong signal used to restart accumulation (new_acc instead of fft_sync)
  - use python code from snap_adc5g_feng_rpi to read vacc snapshot units
  - recompile
  - Wrong signal used to restart accumulation (new_acc instead of fft_sync)
    - No, it was ok.
    - Simulate this part to understand why the chans are not right

## 2021/11/15

- adc_sst_v3
  - Lost in the way...
  - Add fft_out_pwr[01]_0to7 that are computation of instantenous power of fft_out[01]_0to7 for debug.
  - recompile
  - instantenous powers fft_out_pwr[01]_0to7 look good.
  - But vacc_ss snapshot blocs are full of zeros...
  - Reduce snapshot depth to 2^8 (was 2^9)
  - recompile

## 2021/10/15

- adc_sst_v3
  - vacc outputs truncated to 8 bits (should be 64...)
  - recompile

## 2021/10/14

- adc_sst_v2
  - Can get snapshots of complex waveforms on the output of the 8 lanes of the 2 fft modules and could reformat them for plotting
  - 256-sample periodic patterns -> OK with a 2048-sample FFT on 8 lanes.
  - But the VACC was setup for 128-sample patterns -> fix adc_sst_v3 and start a new fit

## 2021/09/26

- adc_sst_v2
  - Fits properly
  - ADC at 3.6 GEch/s with snapshots
  - PFB 2 taps (for quick fit...)
  - FFT real 2048 chans with snapshots
  - Auto and cross correlation
    - acc_len
    - snapshots on either XX/YY or XY
    - Ready to be replaced by 1GbE framer
  - TODO:
    - Tests fft_shift, acc_len, ...
- Create adc_sst_v3 for backup
  - Will probably include 1GbE framer
  

## 2021/09/25

- New latency in PFB and FFT to ease timing closure
- adc_sst_v1 fit properly (design is only ADC, PFB and FFT with snapshot modules)
- Starts adc_sst_v2 to add auto and cross power estimators
  - Did it with matlab 2013b, but issues during compile -> restart from scratch with 2012b


## 2021/09/23

- After testing with several DAC/AOP cables, 10G switch and 10G NIC of COPPER5:
  - nanunib NIC is not working (link always down)
  - ROACH is streaming data with roach2_tut_tge tutorial -> roach.pcap read:
  - No.	Time	Source	Destination	Protocol	Length	Info
    ```
    1	0.000000	192.168.5.20	192.168.10.13	UDP	1066	10000 → 60000 Len=1024
    2	0.000163	192.168.5.20	192.168.10.13	UDP	1066	10000 → 60000 Len=1024
    3	0.000327	192.168.5.20	192.168.10.13	UDP	1066	10000 → 60000 Len=1024
    ```

## 2021/09/21

- Moved back roach2 to computer building.
  - Connections OK
  - 10G DAC SFP cable not seen by nanunib 10GbE NIC interface -> check that...

## 2021/09/13

- PFB and FFT are quite heavy to generate and the adc_sst design is getting very slugish
  - Create nrt_bw1800_ch2048_fft.slx and nrt_bw1800_ch2048_pfb.slx, and will blackbox them using memo ["Optimize CASPER Development by “Black Boxing” Designs"](./doc/Black_box_memo.pdf)
  - Could fit a design with PFB 2 taps 2048 chans + FFT and snapshots for a BW = 1800 MHz
  - Add auto/cross-correlations now

## 2021/09/11

- Meeting to decide more precise specifications
  - RF BW = 1800MHz if possible (1700-1750 at least if not)
    - Used to process data after the transposition unit, or direct sampling of BF feed.
  - Sefram
    - 1024-2048 channel (~ 1MHz), 10Hz
    - XX, YY, XY
  - Channelizer
    - 64 channels
    - Channel selection if possible

## 2021/08/31

- Struggling to open tutorials_devel/roach2/tut_spec and tutorials_devel/roach2/tut_corr
  - Posting the issue on CASPER Slack
    - Probably because were saved with matlab 2013
    - Jack pointed me to this design:
      - https://github.com/realtimeradio/ata_snap/blob/main/snap_adc5g_feng_rpi.slx
      - https://github.com/jack-h/ami_correlator/blob/master/amisa.slx

- Compiling tutorials_devel/roach2/tut_tge to get acquainted with 10GbE configuration

## 2021/08/26

- Can program FPGA and Valon
- Can read free running counter
- Can write a & b, and read sum_a_b
- Using adc_and_regs project to get data from ADCs.
  - OK for snapshot0
    - Line at 200 or 250 MHz
    - Can plot FFT
  - KO for snapshot1
    - Data stuck to -128
    - Will open the roach2 case and check connections
      - Only ADC in ZDOk 0 is fed with clk, PPS and Fin...
    - Asking for cabling to be done.
